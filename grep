Grep is used on the command line, in order to read text from within a file, and display the results either in the terminal, or piped to another file or way of displaying, for example less, or another text file.

eg grep monkey animals.txt

It can be used in conjuction with wildcards (*), or with regular expressions, in order to further narrow down the results.
